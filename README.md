# PanoptoPageComponent

This is an additional Plugin for the Panopto Plugin, thus it only works with Panopto installed (see https://github.com/fluxapps/Panopto).
It allows you to add videos from Panopto in any Text-Media-Editor in ILIAS.

## Getting Started

```bash
mkdir -p Customizing/global/plugins/Services/COPage/PageComponent/
cd Customizing/global/plugins/Services/COPage/PageComponent
git clone https://github.com/fluxapps/PanoptoPageComponent.git
```
As ILIAS administrator go to "Administration->Plugins" and install/activate the plugin.
